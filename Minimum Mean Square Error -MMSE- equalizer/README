Equalization is the reversal of distortion incurred by a signal transmitted through a channel. 
MMSE(Minimum Mean Square Error) equalizer is one of the linear filters. It designs the filter to minimize E[jej2], 
where e is the error signal, which is the filter output minus the transmitted signal.
In this experiment, we are going to simulate transmission of the BPSK signals, 
comparing the performances of MMSE equalizers of different lengths and under different channel models.
